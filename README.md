A Python 3 program that performs clustering of an input two-dimensional sample into 15 clusters by several methods. The result of each clustering is a graph picture. The program is written in an object-oriented style.

The file with the input sample: http://cs.joensuu.fi/sipu/datasets/s1.txt

Clustering is performed using the scikit-learn module, and graphics using matplotlib.
